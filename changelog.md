# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project tries to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). :)

## [3.2.6] - Jan 1, 2020
Happy New Year!
TweenMax has been removed from core and is now included in the scrollmagic package.
If you dont want it, you dont need it.
To include scrollmagic open the _scrollmagic.php in the inc folder and uncomment the add_action

## [3.2.5] - Dec 1, 2019
Ignition is getting easier to plug and play blocks and extra functionality
Files that you want added to custom.js can be in one of 3 places.
- Inside custom folder like always
- inside template parts, but it must start with an underscore _file.js
- inside inc folder, but it too must start with an underscore _file.js

PHP files can now be auto included by placing them in either template-parts or inc folders and starting with an underscore. _file.php <br>
This will allow for future drag and dropping folders of functionality that will plug and play without much work, as the proper php files with auto include. <br>
The underscored php file must not be nested more than 3 folders deep as the scan wont go any deeper for precautions.
The following is acceptable: template-parts/acf-blocks/some-section/_file.php

All this will allow you to drag and drop folders with php and js inside that will be auto included onto your site.
scss files from template-parts and inc will also be added to your sass main.scss automatically.



## [3.2.4] - Nov 5, 2019
BIG Changes. Now you can add JS and sass files within the template-parts folder. These files will get added into the assets folder automagically and then compile.
With these changes, a few files were added, removed or moved around.
 - Re added support for internationalization.
 - Moved around some sass files and sass content:
   - added articles.scss for all article styles. This replaces archives.scss
    - moved some styles into template-parts/post/post.scss from articles.scss
    - Added global/defaults.scss with some site defaults taken from other sass files.
    - removed headers.scss and footers.scss because the content from those is now in defaults.scss.
 - Added ability to show ign_loop function as opposed to the long conditionals. Easily allows routing to the right content without a lot of lines by using the ign_loop function
